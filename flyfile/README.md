# FlyFile

A really simple example of file-sharing between browsers using FlyWeb.

The "file sharer" visits the flyfile `index.html` page on their browser, selects one or more files, types a name to share under, and hits the "Share" button.

This starts a FlyWeb service.

The "file receiver" uses their browser to discover FlyWeb services, and sees the service name that the sharer specified.  Connecting to that service takes the reeiver to a web-page which lets them see and download the files to their own device.

Please excuse the 90s grad student web aesthetic.  I'm not a web designer, if you have not already figured that out from looking at `index.html`.  Let's just pretend that this is actually intentional and that I'm going for a "retro" look.

Cheers.
